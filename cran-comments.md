NOTES:
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  VDM (8:22)
  VPE (8:48)
  VVE (8:14)
  Vorteks (3:29, 8:5, 10:53)

VDM, VPE, VVE, Vorteks are all names of applications that this package is designed to export dataframes to.

Note about platform: The above mentioned applications are Windows only applications. Thus this package does not perform any useful functionality unless you are on Windows. There's no way to avoid the Windows only platform. The package is written such that it will install and run on other platforms, but the exported files will not open in the Vorteks software like they do on Windows.
